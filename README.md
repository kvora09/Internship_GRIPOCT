**Task 1: Prediction using Supervised ML**
1)Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
2) What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
3) Dataset : http://bit.ly/w-data

**Task 2:Prediction using Unsupervised ML**
1)From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
2) Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
3)I have used K-means clustering to predict the optimum clusters and elbow method to conclude from the graph.Finally,I have demonstrated the same using the scatter plot.

**Task 3:Exploratory Data Analysis**
1)Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
2)As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where we can work to make more profit.

2)Use animation, timeline and annotations to create attractive and interactive dashboards and story
3)Identify interesting patterns and possible reasons helping Covid-19 spread with basic as well as advanced charts
4)Screen-record the completed storyboard along with your audio explaining the charts and giving recommendations.
